        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m engineer, expert of printing and publishing. After the post-pc era, the way of doing communication has dramatically changed, so I understood that it was time for me to reinvent my skills, since the interest of people was quickly moving from printed paper to something much more attractive. For this reason, I started to study again, combining my previous experience of publisher together with my first vocation, engineering. And I realized that making websites is much more complex, as well engaging, than making a magazine or a book.</p>
        <p>So, I started to frequent online courses trying to go as deeper as possible. I mastered several tools from Adobe CC, and I did my experience until now by creating websites using the Business Catalyst platform.</p>
        <p>I like to have full control of processes, and the more I study, the more I become hungry, because I am really taken from this universe. So I decided to accept the Treehouse challenge, and I subscribed to this Teachdegree. And I like to believe that if things will go in the right way, I will try to master more and more arguments through Teachdegree experiences.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p> The use of a grafic interface to build a website is not enough for me. In fact I like to understand what I am doing. For this reason I need to possibly have full control of the processes that I manage. I really desire to master the process of building web sites. </p>

        <p>When I will have a solid base background, I will try to extend my knowledge trying to master: </p>

          <li><img src="images/logos/python-logo.png" alt="Pyton"></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Least, but not last, because we live in the post pc era, mobile devices are more and more important. So, to complete my training and to be able to provide to my clients the best experience, I think important also to master in iOS and Android Development.</p>
